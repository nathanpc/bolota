# Bolota

A note taking application for people that strictly use the
[outline method](https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/outline-note-taking-method) of
note taking and want a tool that was designed for taking notes in that style
as quickly and as productive as possible.

## The name

The name might seem a bit odd to some people, it's the portuguese name for an
[acorn](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolota), which I thought was fitting given
that most outline notes use bullet points (if you imagine enough they can turn
into acorns).
